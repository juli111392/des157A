                <p>
                    For this extra credit revision, I wanted to make the Cat Sushi game feel more complete, so I focused on improving the visuals and adding little moments of personality throughout the gameplay. One of the biggest changes I made was creating special graphics for rolling a 1 or a 6, and implementing it into the ending screen.

                <p>
                    For the number 6 roll (the highest and best roll), I designed a premium "Gold Sushi" graphic which is basically a golden colored sushi which I plan to add sparkle effects later on. This is the legendary sushi and will stand out from the regular sushi pieces, making players feel rewarded when they roll a 6, which is also the highest value you can roll from the dice.

                    For the number 1 roll (which ends a player's turn), I am creating a playful wasabi bomb character that appears when players roll the "bad" number. It's similar to the game russian roulette and it's a game I used to play with my sisters too. Additionally, I've designed cute sad cat graphics for each player showing their reaction to the spicy wasabi, adding a humorous touch to what would otherwise be a frustrating moment. This visual feedback makes the "bad roll" more engaging and entertaining rather than just disappointing, keeping the game's lighthearted tone.

                    I've also updated the background graphics for both winner screens to create more space for the new sushi collection display feature. The updated layouts ensure that all collected sushi pieces can be clearly displayed without cluttering the screen or covering important visual elements. Additionally, I am creating individual sushi graphics for the collection display system. Each dice number (1-6) will have its corresponding sushi piece that players can see accumulated on their win screen, showing their complete "sushi journey" throughout the game. These graphics are consistent in style but varied enough to make each piece visually distinct and collectible. By improving the visual design, it makes the game have a more polished, professional appearance while adding layers of visual storytelling that make the game more engaging and memorable.
