                I'm using this space to track what I'm learning about web design, interaction, and best practices, and to connect readings to my own projects. Thanks for stopping by and I hope you also learn a thing or two! ^_^

                            Learning Journal 2 – Best Practices for Modals / Overlays
                        </h2>
            
                    <p>I found the “Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows” article really helpful as a designer who works on a lot of website interfaces. I already focus a lot on responsiveness when designing screens across different products, and I feel like I have the main visual guidelines down, but this article made me realize there are so many smaller details I hadn’t really thought about.</p>
                    
                    <p>I learned that the modal’s location matters more than I expected. It should be placed in the upper half of the screen, because on mobile the modal can get lost or pushed down if it sits too low. I also didn’t know that if a modal takes up more than 50% of the screen, it’s better not to use a modal at all.</p>
                    
                    <p>The mobile notes were also super useful. On phones, modals aren’t recommended because the device keyboard and nested scrollbars can make the experience confusing or cramped. Instead of a pop-up, using patterns that fit the phone layout works better.</p>
                    
                    <p>Overall, the article helped me understand how these smaller details can make a big difference in creating a smoother and more intentional user experience.</p>

                        This article titled "Best Practices for Form Design" explores 20 best best practices to boost a form's usability.

                        These are super important points to keep in mind that appear in many of the projects I do. From best ways to present dropdown menus to optomizing placeholder texts, I think many beginner to intermediate desginers can learn a few things.

                        I also like how this article goes deeper than just visuals and layout, they also take into account usability for minority groups such as those who are color blind.

                        Apple has a very user friendly very aesthetically pleasing and easy to navigate website. Their required fields are clearly marked, labels are above fields, and fields match the expected size of their input. Another thing is that for their password format, it shows password rules before typing and there is a "show password" toggle instead of requiring re-typing.

                        Here's the link to Apple's website:
