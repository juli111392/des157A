                I'm using this space to track what I'm learning about web design, interaction, and best practices, and to connect readings to my own projects. Thanks for stopping by and I hope you also learn a thing or two! ^_^

                <p>
                    This article titled "Best Practices for Form Design" explores 20 best best practices to boost a form's usability.

                    These are super important points to keep in mind that appear in many of the projects I do. From best ways to present dropdown menus to optomizing placeholder texts, I think many beginner to intermediate desginers can learn a few things.

                    I also like how this article goes deeper than just visuals and layout, they also take into account usability for minority groups such as those who are color blind.

                    Apple has a very user friendly very aesthetically pleasing and easy to navigate website. Their required fields are clearly marked, labels are above fields, and fields match the expected size of their input. Another thing is that for their password format, it shows password rules before typing and there is a "show password" toggle instead of requiring re-typing.

                    Here's the link to Apple's website:
